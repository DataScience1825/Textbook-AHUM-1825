If you review the R Documentation for the [filter_lab() function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter_lab.html) you'll find the following explanation:

Add a student friendly explanation for filter_lab() here. Keep in mind, this is all done **without modifying or altering the original dataset!** 

## Practice Dataset  
<!-- All datasets should be stored in the SharedResources/dataset/ directory, 
      inside a folder named after the dataset. The dataset folder should contain the following:
        - data.csv - A csv containing the raw data (if available)
        - description.md - A description of dataset and its variables (a sample is provided below)
        - banner.png - A fun/interesting/informative image to represent the dataset. 
                       Ideally a png file, to allow for easy updates to the tutorial's css styling (specifically background-color)
-->

This tutorial's practice exercises will use the [Dataset Name](Dataset URL), which is a (insert description of dataset):\

  - **variable 1** : description 
  - **variable 2**: description  

```{r view_dataset}

## Basic Syntax  

--- 

<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:2em"> <span class="color1">results</span> <- filter_lab(<span class="color2">data</span>, <span class="color3" >parameters</span>)</span>

<dl>
  <dt class="color1 medium">results</dt>
  <dd> `filter_lab()` doesn't actually modify the provided dataset, so you'll need to either store the results in order to use them in other operations or use the pipe **%>%** operator to pass the results onto another function.</dd>
  <dt class="color2 medium">data</dt>
  <dd>Here you provide the name of the dataset you want to work with. For most of our practice exercises, that will be the **provided** dataset.</dd>
  <dt class="color3 medium">parameters</dt>
  <dd>Description of parameters. Extra information on the parameters are listed below: </dd>
</dl>  

--- 

```{r}
simple <- tibble(columnA = 24, columnB = 80, columnC = -3, columnD = 11) 
simple
```

--- 

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p class="color3 medium bolder" style="margin-bottom:0px;">param1</p> Description of param1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> `filter_lab(simple, param1)`</td> 
    <td>
      `#r filter_lab(simple, param1)`
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><p class="color3 medium bolder" style="margin-bottom:0px;">param2</p> Description of param2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> `filter_lab(simple, param2)`</td> 
    <td>
      `#r filter_lab(simple, param2)`
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Practice Problem 1
Finish the code block, so that ....
```{r filter_lab_practice1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.blanks = "___+"}

```

```{r filter_lab_practice1-solution}

```

```{r filter_lab_practice1-check}

## Homework

--- 

<!-- 
  The description for the homework dataset
-->  

```{r include_hmw, child="data/hmw_data_description.Rmd"}
```

<!-- 

  Homework problems are stored in a separate file "homework_#.Rmd", where the # represents a specific set of homework problems.
  To switch homework problems, use the uilities functions updateAllHomeworks(hmw_number) or updateOneHomework(tutorial, hmw_number)
-->
```{r, child="homework_1.Rmd"}
```
<!-- 
  The hmw_grader.Rmd child contains event listeners that evaluate a student's work each time they submit/answer a problem
-->
```{r, child="../SharedResources/grading/hmw_grader.Rmd"}
```
<!-- 
  The download_homework.Rmd child adds a button for students to download their homework submission.
  This report only includes the homework problems and none of the practice problems.
-->
```{r, child="../SharedResources/grading/download_homework.Rmd"}
```


## Additional Practice Problems

--- 

**Warning**: These additional practice problems go beyond what is covered in this tutorial. They are meant to help you strengthen your coding skills. This means that you may have to use new functions, new libraries, or really think "out of the box" to solve them. If you get stuck, make sure to read through the provided hints! 

<!-- 
  When possible, make sure to include additional problems for students to work on. These are placed
  after homework exercises because they go beyond what would be expected for class assignments. Or to 
  put it another way, the homework problems prepare students for future quizzes and exams, but the 
  additional practice problems prepare students for their final project and coding challenges 
  beyond this class.
